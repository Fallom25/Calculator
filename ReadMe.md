## Basic HTML Calculator - Project for _Nology

## Project Description
The aim of this project was to build a basic Calculator

## How to Install and Run
I use the VSCode extension LiveServer to run my HTML websites locally.

## How to use
Works the same way a simple calculator works.
Smile button displays Surprise Pic on timer.

## Outline of my Solution
Uses HTML, CSS and JS. Uses the Sass preprocess. 

## Considerations and Further Growth
Would like to add the ability for users to enter their own delim.

### Testing
Tests are written but are not working properly with current set up.
Window Alert is not currently being tested this is something I would like to add in the future.
